How Flutter Apps Becomes Active:
  1.main() -this function executed automatically ,By Dart whne executing the compiled app on the target device.
  2.runnApp()- shoul be called inside the main method, tells Flutter what to display on the screen (eg: which UI elements to display)
  3.A widget tree is a combination of (nested)Flutter widgets that build the overall user interface.
  

  Understanding const:
    const helps Dart optimize runtime performance.
eg: 
    const Text('hello world') // first time in ur app
    const Text('hello world') // seocnd time in ur app

    both takes same memory thats why we are using const

****** If image gets error,try Runing this:

flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run


OutlinedButton.icon(
  onPressed (method )
  label:
)
// normally we use onPressed and child in button but if we add one constructor with that we have to use label instead of child.


***** For adding Google fonts :
  run - flutter pub add google_fonts ,this code to get all fonts..u can check dependency in pubspec.yaml
  in 37th line- google_fonts: ^6.2.1

  How to use fonts ..for eg Text("hello" , style: GoogleFonts.roboto(color:Colors.red,fontSize:24)),
  same Like TextStyle we are using GoogleFonts.roboto and add textStyle like color,fontSize etc..
